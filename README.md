# create-node-meeting-artifacts
Tool to create artifacts for node.js team meetings

Uses the Foundation calendar to find the next instance of the meeting, and then creates an issue and matching google doc for minutes.

Re-uses make-node-meeting for much of the content generation.

The hardest part to get going is doing the google auth setup as described in: https://github.com/mhdawson/google-auth-wrapper.

Will add more documentation, when I have time.

Currently I'm testing out for generation of the  Node.js TSC meetings.
